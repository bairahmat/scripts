                      A command before every bash command

                   Does anyone know a mean of putting a 'time' command before 
                   every command in a bash session?

                   Sorry for the wrong answer before, I missunderstood your   
                   question.                                                  
                                                                              
                   To have the time added before every command that you       
                   execute on the shell you can do something like this        
                                                                              
                   bind 'RETURN: "\e[1~time \e[4~\n"'                         
                                                                              
                   This will rebind the return key. Now every time you press  
                   return instead of writing a newline \n it will go to the   
                   beginning of the line, enter the text 'time' and a space,  
                   go to the end of the line and enter the newline \n thereby 
                   producing the desired effect.                              
                                                                              
   up vote 34 down If you don't want to sacrifice your Enter Key you could    
   vote accepted   make a 'second' benchmark-enter Key like F12 by binding    
                   the command like this                                      
                                                                              
                   bind '"\e[24~": "\e[1~time \e[4~\n"'                       
                                                                              
                   Now instead of replacing the return key you bound F12.     
                                                                              
                   The background of all this is that bash uses GNU readline  
                   to read commands. So readline would be a good starting     
                   point for further command manipulation, etc.

                        +1 nice solution! i like the idea of having a         
                   1    benchmarking enter key separate from the regular      
                        enter key. – quack quixote Mar 11 '10 at 5:13         
                        that's a clever idea. How can you generalize it to    
                        execute a user-defined function before every command? 
                        I don't know how to combine bash code and a readline  
                        function in the same binding. – Gilles Aug 14 '10 at

                  I realize that this is outside of the scope of this         
                  question but...                                             
                                                                              
                  In zsh (which, is to my knowledge a super set of bash) if   
                  you set the following variable in your .zshrc file:         
                                                                              
                  export REPORTTIME=5                                         
                                                                              
   up vote 5 down Every command that takes longer than 5 seconds (I'm pretty  
   vote           sure) will display the output of time. All commands that    
                  complete more quickly don't. And in those cases one doesn't 
                  really care, so it's nice to not clutter things up. There   
                  are also a lot of other cool features in zsh that you might 
                  enjoy while you're at it.

                       Nice tip. While zsh surely has a superset of the       
                       functionality of bash, its syntax is not a superset of 
                       the syntax of bash, so it is not a â**drop inâ**       
                       replacement. – Chris Johnsen Mar 8 '10 at 6:11

                  PS1 seems like the standard way to do something like this.

                  2    It modifies the display, not the actual executed

                       @grawity Right - but it would get you exactly what you 
                       want ... the time prepended to every line. – Jason

                       Which is completely different from what time does (it  
                  3    measures how long did it take for a command to         
                       execute). – grawity Mar 10 '10 at 12:29                
                       @grawity, I guess you're right -- you'd have to do the 
                       subtraction yourself. Looks like @Jrobert had the same 
                       idea. – Jason Sundram Mar 10 '10 at 18:20

          Include \t in your prompt string. It will include the time in your  
          prompt at the point where you include it. See:

               True; and the difference between that and the next prompt's    
               current time is the run-time (minus typing time, of course -   
               pasting is your friend here). No key reassignments necessary.
