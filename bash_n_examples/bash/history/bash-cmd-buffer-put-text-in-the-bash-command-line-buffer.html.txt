                    Put text in the bash command line buffer

                       I would like to programmatically put a certain piece   
                       of text in the command line buffer of bash, read to be 
                       edited and used as a command.                          
                                                                              
                       What I am looking forward to is something similar to   
                       read -i but for commands.                              
                                                                              
                         -i text If readline is being used to read the line,  
                         text is placed into the editing buffer before        
                         editing begins.

             If this for a function that you're going to use in a readline    
             binding with bind -x then you can modify READLINE_LINE.          
             (Example)                                                        
                                                                              
             Outside of a readline binding, you can push a fake command onto  
   up vote 4 the history with history -s.                                     
   down vote

                  @gioele You have to launch it from within the shell (e.g.   
                  from a script that you load with source). You can't do      
                  anything from a separate process. – Gilles Jul 12 '13 at

     I found a hacky way of doing this on the fzf examples page. This works with    
     bash 4.3 and perl 5.18:                                                        
                                                                                    
     writecmd () {                                                                  
       perl -e 'ioctl STDOUT, 0x5412, $_ for split //, do{ chomp($_ = <>); $_ }' ;  
     }                                                                              
up                                                                                  
vote # Example usage                                                                
4    echo 'my test cmd' | writecmd                                                  
down                                                                                
vote It prints out the command to stdout, but copies it to the command buffer as    
     well. There is also an example on the linked page if you want to execute the   
     command directly.

                  Gilles' answer is correct, but not completely satisfying.   
                  As I read this question, the OP wants to "preseed" the next 
                  input line. In my case I wanted to read the terminal's      
                  current position in my PROMPT_COMMAND function. That works  
                  but uses the same read buffer as the primary shell's, and   
                  so any user input gets discarded by the fact that I did a   
                  'read' builtin call in the function. So I wanted to read    
                  the user input separately, do my terminal read, and then    
                  put the read input back in the input buffer, which is the   
                  original question. Note that this is indeed within the same 
   up vote 2 down process, so theoretically it should be possible.            
   vote                                                                       
                  As far as I can see (on my bash 4.2) there is no function   
                  to push something to the input stack programmatically. In   
                  zsh there is using 'print -z'.                              
                                                                              
                  So the answer is: this is not possible in bash, you need to 
                  use zsh for this.
