put them into directories - name directories (subcategories)
(some additional files will be created :( )

-put common category files into ??comm directory (where ? is a
numeric character) and create something.commident files to identify
category. (touch something.commident)

-put alternate group names (only the ident-file) to .tags directory
by creating something.tagident files. (touch something.tagident)
