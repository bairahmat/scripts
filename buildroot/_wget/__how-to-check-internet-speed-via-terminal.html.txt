                   How to check Internet Speed via Terminal?

               Instead of going to sites like speedtest.net, or others, I     
               want to check my current Internet speed from the terminal on   
               Ubuntu. How can I do it?

                    consider speedtest-cli to be in any way a valid test of

                    @user375058: The speedtest-cli uses the same servers      
                    (etc.) as SpeedTest.net. You should consider the          
                    speedtest-cli and www.speedtest.net to be equivalent,     
                    just with a different front-end. I would be surprised if  
                    you get significantly different results consistently if   
               1    they both use the same server. If they aren't using the   
                    same server, then you have no basis for comparison.       
                    Lastly, my results for both utilities vary by a factor of 
                    2-4 from run to run. I suggest you test 2-4 servers, and  
                    perform 3â**4 runs for each server and compare tools.

         I recommend the speedtest-cli tool for this. I created a blog post (Measure Internet         
         Connection Speed from the Linux Command Line) that goes into detail of downloading,          
         installing and usage of it.                                                                  
                                                                                                      
         The short version is this: (no root required)

         Output:

              This doesnt seem to work properly. I have BT infinity 50bBit down and 20Mbit up. But    
         1    the results show up as 0.53Mbit down and 0.2Mbit up. Huh? Incorrect decimal placing?    
              using wget I get 4.27M/s (34Mbit) (some other server though)? – ppumkin Sep 2 '13 at

              As it has already been stated here: Since speedtest-cli is a python application, it is  
         19   much easier to install by doing: pip install speedtest-cli or: easy_install             
              speedtest-cli Depending on how Python is installed on your system, you may need to be   
              root to do the above. – CrandellWS Feb 9 '14 at 4:18                                    
         1    Confirming that speedtest-cli is broken. Doesn't show speeds above 1Mbps. Doesn't       
              transfer any info when claiming to do so. – int_ua Sep 10 '14 at 0:32                   
              This should really be the accepted answer...speedtest-cli is working fine for me; think 
         4    @int_ua was either having compatibility problems or internet problems. – peelman Oct 30

              This should be the right answer. Speed test means download AND upload. First answer     
         1    ONLY measures the download speed, which is NOT a full picture of your internet          
              connection speed. Especially if you are hosting something on that machine! – Emil

         Note that the test file is a 500 MB file. You can change the test500.zip to test10.zip  
     1   (for example) to try a 10 MB file. I hear this also works with 100 MB. – jvriesem Oct

        a sum.                                                                   
                                                                                 
        iperf is simple and easy to use.

              Well I use wget for it. That little tool tells me nicely what   
              speed I have.                                                   
                                                                              
              To use it just point to a file in internet that is relatively   
              bigger so that you can get a better estimate of it.             
                                                                              
              For example                                                     
                                                                              
              typing: wget http://hostve.com/neobuntu/pics/Ubu1.avi would     
              start to download the Ubu1.avi file and show at what speed it   
              is downloading.                                                 
                                                                              
              enter image description here                                    
                                                                              
              Of course there are several recommendations:                    
                                                                              
               1. Speed test yourself with good servers. In the case of my    
                  link the speed is less than 200KB so if you have a higher   
                  speed, the server will be the bottleneck for you, not your  
                  actual speed.                                               
                                                                              
               2. The highest speed you will see is the maximum speed that    
                  your connection and the server's connection can offer. If   
                  your connection is 512KB and the place where you are        
                  downloading is 400KB, your max connection will be 400KB     
                  because it is the max for the server you are downloading    
                  from.                                                       
                                                                              
               3. You need to do the test at least 5 times to have a reliable 
                  speed check or at least do it for a minute or two. This     
                  will help you have a more accurate check.                   
                                                                              
               4. You need to have at least 4 or 5 different testing sources  
   up vote 29     to have a more accurate speed. Never test only from the     
   down vote      same site as this can be affected by your distance to it,   
                  any problem in the server and the connections to it, etc.   
                  Always test from different servers.                         
                                                                              
              ARIA2                                                           
                                                                              
              This is an alternative to wget. The downside of wget is the     
              lack of parallel connections. To use aria2 we fist need to      
              download it:                                                    
                                                                              
                 sudo apt-get install aria2                                   
                                                                              
              To use it is simple:                                            
                                                                              
              enter image description here                                    
                                                                              
              In the image, the -x 4 is how many parallel connections we wish 
              to use. The CN parameter in the next line shows how many active 
              parallel connections were permitted to download from that site. 
              In this case CN is 4. But if we tried to have more connections  
              we would get something like this:                               
                                                                              
              enter image description here                                    
                                                                              
              We set 8 parallel connections but the site only allowed a       
              maximum of 5 as shown by CN:5. This could be solved by the -j   
              option which tells aria2c the maximum concurrent connections we 
              want (Which by default is 5) but if the server has limited      
              this, -j will not work.

                   wget is not (yet) able to do a segmented download, that is 
                   to download a single file using multiple (parallel)        
                   connections, so if your ISP is limiting the speed per 1    
              1    connection, you won't get accurate results... it would be  
                   a more precise test to use some other tool, that can at    
                   least use segmented download (like aria2) – Mladen B. Aug

                   This is NOT a speedtest, this is a DOWNLOAD speed test     
              2    only! Internet speed test means down&up load! Second       
                   answer, and all others mentioning speedtest-cli have the   
                   correct approach. – Emil Borconi Jan 20 '15 at 14:16       
                   @EmilBorconi You are correct but in real life, we are not  
                   doing benchmarking Internet speeds here, this are just     
                   your average current speed tests of any home user without  
                   the need for sites like speedtest. A download speed (Which 
                   is enough for anyone trying to see if they are having a    
                   bottleneck) is a good enough test. A full down/up speed    
                   test would check what the full scope of your speed is      
                   based on your ISP. So yeah that would be the best          
                   solution, but for any fast test scenario, even a simple    
                   wget would do the trick since normally people worry more   
                   about download speed than upload. – Luis Alvarado♦ Jan 20

                   @LuisAlvarado sorry if I sounded rude, just I think people 
                   should be able to fully understand what they are asking /  
                   and what is the accepted answer. Lot's of newbies will     
                   look at forums and they will assume / pick / stop at the   
                   accepted answer, and they form a false image in their had. 
              1    And yes download is more important then upload unless you  
                   are a facebook maniac who post selfies each 5 minutes,     
                   then start a fight with you ISP just because you tested    
                   the download which is good, but you have a crappy          
                   upload... Once again sorry if my tone was rude, did not    
                   want to insult... – Emil Borconi Jan 21 '15 at 9:52

             you can use tespeed . it is a Terminal network speed test that   
             uses servers from Speedtest.net. It uses nearest test server but 
             can also use one manually specified by the user.                 
                                                                              
              git clone git://github.com/Janhouse/tespeed.git                 
              cd tespeed                                                      
              git submodule init                                              
              git submodule update                                            
              ./tespeed.py

             for more info use :

             it will provide more option for speed test.

             Run several instances of wget with timeout command on large      
             files:                                                           
                                                                              
             #!/bin/bash                                                      
                                                                              
             timeout 5 wget -q url_1/100MB.zip &                              
             timeout 5 wget -q url_2/file.zip &                               
             timeout 5 wget -q url_3/sample.mov &                             
             timeout 5 wget -q url_4/speech.mp4 &                             
                                                                              
             And then write a script to calculate the total bytes downloaded  
   up vote 2 and divide 5 seconds you will get a bytes/sec figure. Should be  
   down vote quite accurate and you can add more instances to max your        
             bandwidth.                                                       
                                                                              
             I have yet to test the full script but the single line command   
             "timeout 5 wget url" works, and you get a partially downloaded   
             file as a result (if 5 secs is not enough to complete the        
             download).

                  url_1,2,3,4 can be anything, such as public servers.

                  /tmp/temp5sec then analyze the filesize and devide by 5:    
                  expr $(stat --printf="%s" /tmp/temp5sec) / 5 / 1024 in

     Simple bash script based on @rexis answer. You can put your own links for testing in links array or read them from file

     a simple one-liner that tests how long it takes to download 100MB (works on /bin/sh also):

     explanation:                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                    
      1. store the timestamp in $t                                                                                                                  
      2. download 100mb but don't store anything                                                                                                    
      3. calculate 8 * 100mb / $t

down http://speedtest.tweak.nl/100mb.bin gives a faster download, so it seems like http://speedtest.netcologne.de does only offer 30 MBit/s max.

     The problem in my OpenWRT console is that I cannot access speedtest.tweak.nl which is strange
