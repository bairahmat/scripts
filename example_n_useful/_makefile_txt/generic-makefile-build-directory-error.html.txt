             My current generic Makefile is below,

             $(TARGET): $(OBJECTS)                                            
                 $(CC) -o $@ $^                                               
                                                                              
             clean:                                                           
                 rm -rf $(shell find * -name *.o) $(TARGET)                   
                                                                              
             This all compiles fine however it just dumps the .o files into   
             the same directory as its corresponding .c file.                 
                                                                              
             What I would like to do is have all object files put into a      
             build directory. To do this I change the OBJECTS to OBJECTS :=   
             $(patsubst %,build/%,$(notdir $(SOURCES:.c=.o))) which lists the 
             files build/getmsg.o build/main.o. Then I set the %.o target to  
             build/%.o: %.c.                                                  
                                                                              
             This however returns No rule to make target 'build/getmsg.o'. So 
             the make file is unable to build the .o files. What am I missing 
             here?                                                            
                                                                              
             makefile directory gnu-make
