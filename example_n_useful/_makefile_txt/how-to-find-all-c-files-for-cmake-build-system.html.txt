                how to find all *.c files for Cmake build system

   Ask Question

         I want to find all .c files under a directory and add them all to SRC files to compile in    
         cmake. How can I do this in CMakeList.txt.

This question came from our site for computer enthusiasts and power users.
              Note that "collect all source files with glob" is not recommended in CMake: We do not   
              recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from your source tree. If no     
              CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or removed then the generated build  
              system cannot know when to ask CMake to regenerate. -- from documentation – Franklin Yu

                   Try this:                                                  
                                                                              
                     AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY                                     
                                                                              
                     Find all source files in a directory.                    
                                                                              
                    AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY(dir VARIABLE)                        
                                                                              
                     Collects the names of all the source files in the        
                     specified directory and stores the list in the variable  
                     provided. This command is intended to be used by         
                     projects that use explicit template instantiation.       
                     Template instantiation files can be stored in a          
                     "Templates" subdirectory and collected automatically     
                     using this command to avoid manually listing all         
                     instantiations.

   vote accepted     It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the  
                     list of source files for a library or executable target. 
                     While this seems to work, there is no way for CMake to   
                     generate a build system that knows when a new source     
                     file has been added. Normally the generated build system 
                     knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the           
                     CMakeLists.txt file is modified to add a new source.     
                     When the source is just added to the directory without   
                     modifying this file, one would have to manually rerun    
                     CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new   
                     file.

                       @SaoPauloooo, as it's written next, "there is no way   
                       for Cmake to generate a buildsystem that knows when a  
                   1   new source file has been added". This command is the   
                       most close answer to OP's question. Fine for me.

                   This works great, but does it avoid the caveat (that CMake 
                   won't know when new files are added) in the other two      
                   answers? – kylewm Apr 3 '12 at 0:08                        
              1    No, it doesn't. You will still need to re-run CMake once a 
                   new file is added. – Dat Chu Apr 25 '12 at 18:24           
                   (which ended up being fine for my needs... easier than     
              8    editing the CMakeList every time you add a source file)

              4    There's also GLOB_RECURSE if you want to find the files    
                   recursively. – emlai Jul 11 '16 at 14:45

     If you want to create an executable file using above source code this is the command:                          
                                                                                                                    
      ADD_EXECUTABLE(autopilot ${autopilot})

           You can use AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY as @whitequark described, but it  
           won't really work as you expect, as CMake will be unable to        
           determine when new files are added (which is kind of the whole     
   up vote point with using a wildcard).

               AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY is performed well for now. Thank you so   
           2   much. AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY(${PROJECT_INC_DIR}control/src       
               CTR_SOURCES) ADD_EXECUTABLE( ${EXE_NAME} ${CTR_SOURCES} )
