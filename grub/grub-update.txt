modify grub2 and os-prober (create backup; copy files by overwriting original)
to make it "distribution friendly"
(eg.: some linux disrto loads microcode by initrd line "separately")
(grub-mount replaced with mount)
(you may set up grub to find other os-es on other partitions
	execute permission on file: /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober
	#turn on
	chmod 755 /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober
	#turn off
	chmod 644 /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober)
(grub 2.02)
(os-prober 1.75)
